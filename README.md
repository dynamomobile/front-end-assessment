- ⚠️ If you have any question regarding this assessment, feel free to ask us before you start it.

- A friendly UI (transitions, fonts, effects, could be nice)

- The user has access to a protected page which will show:

  - A list with the latest launches with a toggle which can be alternated the view mode to grid or list mode

    - with pagination (limit 50 per page)

  - When clicked on a item it will show the launch details including:
    - carousel for images if it's available
    - mission details (show also social media profiles for the mission if it's available)
    - rocket details
    - payload details
    - if it has video link or an YouTube ID available, show a video player for that
